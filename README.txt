Carlota Vina Neighborhood Map

Project is in repository

https://github.com/CarlotaVina/projectv7.git

Download this github repository.

This project has two files. One is a javascript called  viewNeighborhoodOriginal2.html. This file is the view.
The other one is the model,  a javascript called project5.

The view shows a search bar where the user can search locations that he wants. A list shows the locations that exist
in the maps. And the map. The maps has markers for each location.

To search location fill the input text and click enter.

When the user writes a location in the search bar, the list updates with the locations matches with the location and automatically the markers
are updated. Markers can be clicked. When the marker is clicked, a window is opened with more information.

To execute this project is necessary to open viewNeighborhoodOriginal2.html with the browser Chrome.

I use FourSquare to load more information about the marker.
